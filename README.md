Done as a part of coursework in EE698R : Advanced Topics in Machine Learning under Dr. Vipul Arora, during 2021-22 II. 

Attached is a Jupyter file containing the model code required for rerunning the project. Also a presentation for the work done is attached.

Project Description :


• Explored RNN architectures such as LSTM, Conv‑RNN to learn temporal dependencies and mask certain frequencies.

• Used Separation Network in time domain to tackle window size‑ Latency trade‑off using nussl and scaper library.

• Proposed a solution to problem of diminishing gradient by adding skip connection between layers
